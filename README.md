# React Learning

This repository is dedicated to my daily learning journey with React. Here I upload examples, notes, and code snippets as I explore new concepts, features, and best practices in React development.

##  Purpose

- Document daily progress in learning React
- Share code samples and mini-projects
- Track growth and improvements over time
- Serve as a personal reference for React concepts

## Structure

- Each file or folder represents a specific topic, lesson, or project.
- Example files may include:
  - `react-basics.html`: Basic React concepts and examples
  - More files will be added as I continue learning

## How to Use

- Browse the files for React examples and notes.
- Clone or fork the repository to experiment with the code.
- Feel free to open issues or pull requests with suggestions or improvements!

##  Topics Covered (so far)
